            <li><strong>Warwick fend for the livelihood of Zaunite</strong><br />
                He's rumored to be Vander in the Arcane series, and Vander always put the safety of the Underground
                people first before making any decision.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><strong>Warwick do not kill indiscriminately</strong><br />
                Even when he is turned feral, he remain conscious of his actions and only prey on those who has
                committed major crimes </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><strong>Warwick feels guilty and bewildered everytime the chamber activate</strong><br />
                Despite not being able to resist the chemical pumped into him when he scences blood, he wish to not be
                taken by its effect and fought back as much as he could</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><strong>Warwick playstyle is straightforward and relentless</strong><br />
                No matter how low a Warwick player HP is, through sheer will and non-stop barrage of attack, Warwick can
                heal back up and clutch a bad fight</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><strong>Project Warwick can better showcase the struggle of man and machine</strong><br />
                The skinline is dominated with human champions in bodytight suits and neon visors, however, Warwick can
                demonstrate the purpose of this skinline by having small details incorporated such as organic feet and
                tail. It presented more effort of resisting mechanical changes than all the other champions in this
                skinline</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><strong>Warwick is no longer generic</strong><br />
                Initially, he was just a typical werewolf that hunger for blood. Now, he still hunger for blood not for
                the stupid reason of needing to turn back into human, he is attracted to the scent forcefully but alos
                embraces his monstrous form.</li>
