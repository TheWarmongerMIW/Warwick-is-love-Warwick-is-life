                Once known as Father Wolf, Warwick roamed the wood and revealed in moonlight's bloody hunt. The Eclipse
                Order thought to slay him in his den and end his barbarity - but death means nothing to Old Gods, and he
                did not say down. Father Wolf hows into the night once more, now slavering for the taste of human flesh.

                <header><strong>Lunar Guardian Wariwck</strong></header>
                Gifted to the Lunar Empress when she was a child, Warwick was raised alongside her to guard the immortal
                realm from an encroaching darkness. More beastly and feral this his companion Nasus, Warwick stand watch
                in the south, relentlessly pursuing foes to the ends of the world.
