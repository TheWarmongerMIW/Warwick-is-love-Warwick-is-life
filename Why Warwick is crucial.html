    <h2>Why Warwick is crucial</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>"In fiction, werewolves tend to focus on taming or fighting the beast inside, clinging on to what humanity they have left. The new Warwick has very little of his original humanity remaining. Heâ€™s a beast embracing his newfound savagery."</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>"Warwick is the only and will forever be thing the one true answer that open the door for us all to the new reality, I have accepted and become the herald of the wrath"</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>"Why is he still playing that god forsaken werewolf? It has been four years..."</strong></p>
        <i>~Tsuu, one of Joe's worried friends</i>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>"It's like I don't recognize him anymore, has he already succumbed to the calling of the beast once Warwick was reworked?"</strong></p>
        <i>~Daisy, Joe's former spouse</i>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>"Give us our son back, either you revert the Warwick rework or we'll sue you to the ground"</strong></p>
